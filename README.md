# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive demonstration of applying SQL for **retail sales analysis**. Designed for beginner to intermediate analysts, it simulates a real-world workflow where raw transactional data is transformed into strategic business insights.

The analysis covers the complete data lifecycle from end to end:
-   üìÇ **Database Engineering**: Creating and structuring a relational database from scratch.
-   üßπ **Data Integrity**: Cleaning, validating, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
-   üîé **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovering initial patterns, distributions, and anomalies.
-   üìä **Insight Generation**: Answering critical business questions through targeted SQL queries.

The core objective is to bridge the gap between technical SQL execution and practical business intelligence, showcasing how data can directly inform and optimize decision-making.

**Level**: Beginner-to-Intermediate
**Database**: `p1_retail_db`

## üéØ Key Objectives

-   **Database Setup**: To construct a robust and structured database (`p1_retail_db`) to house retail sales data efficiently.
-   **Data Quality Assurance**: To identify and rectify inconsistencies, null values, and invalid records to ensure data reliability.
-   **Exploratory Analysis**: To understand the fundamental characteristics of the dataset, including sales distributions, customer demographics, and product category performance.
-   **Derive Business Insights**: To formulate and answer specific business questions using SQL queries, translating data into actionable recommendations.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Workflow & Structure

### 1. Database and Table Setup

The foundation of the project involved creating a dedicated database and a well-defined table to store transactional records.

-   **Database Creation**: A new database named `p1_retail_db` was initialized.
-   **Table Schema**: The `retail_sales` table was designed with columns for transaction details, customer information, product specifics, and key sales metrics.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

USE p1_retail_db;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales (
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

Initial queries were run to understand the dataset's scope and to perform necessary cleaning operations.

-   **Record Count**: Determined the total volume of transactions in the dataset.
-   **Unique Customers**: Calculated the size of the distinct customer base.
-   **Product Categories**: Listed all unique product categories to understand the product mix.
-   **Null Value Checks**: Identified and removed incomplete records to ensure the integrity and reliability of the data for analysis.

-- Calculate the total number of records
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM retail_sales;

-- Identify the number of distinct customers
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers FROM retail_sales;

-- List all unique product categories
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

-- Detect rows with any null values
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date IS NULL
   OR sale_time IS NULL
   OR customer_id IS NULL
   OR gender IS NULL
   OR age IS NULL
   OR category IS NULL
   OR quantity IS NULL
   OR price_per_unit IS NULL
   OR cogs IS NULL;

-- Delete incomplete records to ensure data quality
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date IS NULL
   OR sale_time IS NULL
   OR customer_id IS NULL
   OR gender IS NULL
   OR age IS NULL
   OR category IS NULL
   OR quantity IS NULL
   OR price_per_unit IS NULL
   OR cogs IS NULL;


### 3. Data Analysis & Answering Business Questions

A series of targeted SQL queries were developed to extract meaningful insights from the cleaned data. Key business questions addressed include:

1.  What were the total sales on a specific date (e.g., '2022-11-05')?
2.  Which transactions in the 'Clothing' category had high quantities in November 2022?
3.  How do total sales and order counts break down by product category?
4.  What is the average age of customers purchasing 'Beauty' products?
5.  Can we identify all high-value transactions where the total sale exceeded $1000?
6.  What is the transaction count for each gender within each product category?
7.  Which month generated the highest sales revenue for each year on record?
8.  Who are the top 5 customers by total spending?
9.  How many unique customers has each product category attracted?
10. How does sales volume vary by time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)?

### üìä Key Findings

-   üë• **Customer Demographics**: The 'Beauty' and 'Clothing' categories successfully attract a wide range of age groups, indicating broad market appeal.
-   üí∞ **High-Value Sales**: A notable number of transactions exceed $1000, pointing to significant bulk or premium product purchases.
-   üìà **Seasonal Trends**: Analysis revealed clear seasonality, with certain months consistently showing peak sales performance, which is crucial for inventory and marketing planning.
-   üèÜ **Top Customer Contribution**: A small subset of high-spending customers accounts for a disproportionately large share of total revenue, highlighting the importance of customer loyalty programs.
-   ‚è∞ **Shift-Based Insights**: Customer purchasing patterns differ significantly across morning, afternoon, and evening shifts, suggesting opportunities for targeted promotions.

---

### üìÑ Reports & Deliverables

-   **Sales Performance Summary**: A consolidated report detailing total revenue, transaction volumes, and sales contributions by category.
-   **Trend Analysis Report**: An analysis of month-over-month sales patterns to identify growth and seasonality.
-   **Customer Segmentation Insights**: A report identifying top spenders, category-specific customer counts, and key demographic trends.
